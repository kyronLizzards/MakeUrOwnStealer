# Developing Your Own Stealer with JS and Python
Welcome to my repository on developing your own stealer with JS and Python. This project is designed to help you understand the basics of creating a stealer and to provide some tips and tricks for using FUD (Fully Undetectable) methods.

# Getting Started
To get started with developing your own stealer, you will need to have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Python. If you are new to these languages, there are plenty of resources available online to help you get started.

Once you have a basic understanding of these languages, you can start exploring the code in this repository. The code is split into two directories - one for JS and one for Python. Each directory contains sample code and instructions for creating your own stealer.

# FUD Methods
In addition to providing information on developing your own stealer, this repository also includes some tips and tricks for using FUD methods. These methods can help you make your stealer more difficult to detect by antivirus software and other security tools.

Some of the FUD methods covered in this repository include obfuscation, encryption, and packing. These techniques can help you hide the true nature of your code and make it more difficult for security tools to identify it as a threat.

# Conclusion
Developing your own stealer can be a challenging but rewarding experience. By using the code and information provided in this repository, you can get started on your own project and explore the world of FUD methods.

If you have any questions or feedback on this repository, please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you find this information helpful and I wish you the best of luck in your development journey!
